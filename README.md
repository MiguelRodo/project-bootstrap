# Project bootstrap

This repository is Miguel's public, end-to-end project bootstrap procedure. It
coordinates four systems without merging their responsibilities:

- Google Drive holds the canonical project description and LLM-oriented source
  material.
- GitHub holds the repository, Project and authoritative work items.
- `MiguelRodo/projects` supplies the reusable `github-project-admin` workflow.
- A private ChatGPT Project provides the conversational workspace.

The bootstrapper creates resources directly when its current environment has
the required authenticated capability. When it cannot make a GitHub change, it
returns the smallest executable `gh` command block and verifies the result after
the user runs it. ChatGPT Project creation remains a verified manual checklist
in version 1.

## Install the skill

With a current GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh skill install MiguelRodo/project-bootstrap project-bootstrap \
  --agent universal --scope user
```

Then ask, for example:

```text
Use $project-bootstrap to set up a new research project called Foobar.
```

The same skill can resume or audit a partial setup:

```text
Use $project-bootstrap to finish setting up Foobar and verify the result.
```

If skill installation is unavailable, point a capable ChatGPT or Codex chat to
this repository and ask it to follow [`PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP.md`](PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP.md).

## What a completed setup contains

- `work/projects/<year>/<research|lecturing>/<project-slug>/` in Google Drive;
- a native Google Doc named `README` and a `references/llm/` folder;
- an optional, verified GitHub repository and GitHub Project;
- repository onboarding through `MiguelRodo/projects` when both a repository
  and Project are used;
- a bounded project-resources section in the repository README;
- one verified row in the task system's Projects registry; and
- exact manual steps for creating and checking the private ChatGPT Project.

The full human-readable contract is in
[`PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP.md`](PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP.md). Operational agent instructions
live in [`skills/project-bootstrap/SKILL.md`](skills/project-bootstrap/SKILL.md).
